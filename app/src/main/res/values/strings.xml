    <string name="personal_statement">I have over six years of experience developing mobile apps for iOS and Android.
        For the past three years I have worked as an Android developer for Museum of the Bible, and am current serving
        as the lead developer on the Software team there. While my formal education is not in C.S., I have taken the
        online equivalents of all core classes in a standard C.S. undergraduate degree. I am seeking a job in the
        Austin/San Antonio area.
